        I am a web developer with a passion for creating and designing websites.
        I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, MERN Stack, and
        SQL. I just completed the Full Stack Flex Bootcamp from ASU! Fun fact
        about me: I love going out with my girlfriend Rebecca and our dog Cooper
        on hikes and adventures!
